# weatherStation
Arduino weather station code 

After playing around with an arduino for the past 8 or so months learning quite alot in the process and as a keen gardener I wanted to put together something that would help me in some way to grow my own veg and provide the best conditions to do so.  Although its been done a thousand times before I wanted to make a weather station to monitor the weather in our gardens micro climate.

The main aspects that i wanted to cover were the following .
Wind direction
Wind speed
Irridiance
Soil moisture at two different levels, 10cm & 20 cm (yet to add to station )
Air temp 
Relative humidity 
Soil temp at two different levels, 10cm & 20cm (yet to add to sation )
LUX
Barometric pressure.

Heres a list of what currently makes up the weather station 
Arduino Uno Clone
Arduino datalogger shield with ds1307
Dht 22
BMP180
TSL2561
Anenometer from maplin as a replacement part of their wireless weather station.

hope you find this helpful
